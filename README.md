# Data description

The Isolate directory contains four isolate genomes.

The MAG directory contains eight MAGs.

The Others directory contains base sequencing coverage which can be used to calculate the average sequencing coverage across a metagenome-assembled sequence or for 500-bp fragment with 250 bp overlap.
